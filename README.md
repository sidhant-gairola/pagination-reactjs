## Project Description

This project is a React application built with Vite that demonstrates pagination functionality. It fetches product data from an external API and displays it with pagination controls.

## Technology Stack

- **React 19**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces using functional components and hooks.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **react-icons**: A library for including popular icons in React projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code, with plugins for React and hooks.
- **TypeScript types for React**: Provides type definitions to improve code quality and editor support (though the project uses JavaScript/JSX).
